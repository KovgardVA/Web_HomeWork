    <h3><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/trollface">Trollface</a></h3>
    <p>What single image better defines the early experience of the modern internet than the Trollface?</p>
    <h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oavMtUWDBTM">Trololo</a></h3>

        Originally, the song behind this video was the story of "a man,
        Johnny, riding his horse across the American prairie to his
        sweetheart Mary, who knits socks as she waits his return."
        Then it lost its lyrics, and now you can send it to anyone
        you'd like to shut up and/or troll. RIP, Eduard Khil.

    <h3><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-dress-what-color-is-this-dress">#TheDress</a></h3>
    <p>
        Ah, THE DRESS. The great equalizer. You thought you were above
        THE DRESS. You thought you could ignore THE DRESS. You thought
        you could casually observe without repercussions that THE DRESS
        is obviously blue and black, only to find yourself embroiled in
        a three-hour-long argument with your significant other, who
        thought the dress white and gold, that precipitated the end of
        your relationship. THE DRESS exhibited no mercy in its
        overwhelming, brutal dankness.

    <h3><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/people/vladimir-putin">Shirtless Putin</a></h3>
    <p>Vladimir Putin has been the subject of countless memes over his
        seemingly eternal reign heading the Russian oligarchy. While
        "Shirtless Putin" memes—featuring him riding eagles, shootin'
        guns, and engaging in other real-life and photoshopped
        badassery—have been Westernized riffs on his over-the-top and
        well-staged acts of masculinity, the people of Russia have used
        an image of Putin as a gay clown to protest the regime's harsh
        stance on LGBTQ rights. This meme (and all memes of Putin, really)
        were promptly banned by the Kremlin—meaning they clearly got
        under his skin, proving not all memes have to be vessels for
        Dick Butt jokes.</p>
    <h3><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/spongebob-squarepants">SpongeBob</a></h3>
    <p><i>Primitive Sponge</i>. <i>Stunned Patrick</i>. <i>Confused Mr. Krabs</i>. If you
        needed any more proof that SpongeBob SquarePants was amazing,
        and not just for kids, all the show's hilarious
        screengrabs-turned-viral reactions should do the trick.
        They're versatile, recognizable, and proving immortal.</p>
